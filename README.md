# UFO_Todo

UFO_Todo is a straightforward desktop application for managing your tasks, built using Qt/QtQuick technology. Although it’s not perfect, it provides an easy-to-use environment for tracking your daily activities. We’re committed to continually improving the app, so stay tuned for future updates. We hope you find it useful!


### Prerequisites For Project

Before using this template, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:
```diff
Qt                            (Recommended version required: 6.73)
Qt-CMake                      (Minimum version required: 3.16)
Qt-Compiler                   (MSVC, MinGW, GCC, Clang/LLVM, ...)
```

You can choose which Qt modules to use, but we recommend at least the following essential modules:
```diff
Qt-Core
Qt-Widgets
Qt-Gui
Qt-Quick
Qt-QuickControls2
Qt-Network
Qt-Sql
Qt-Multimedia
```

Since QML uses OpenGL, on Linux systems, you may need to install additional dependencies to avoid errors:

```diff
sudo apt install libglx-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```


### Using Project

Once you successfully download the project, you can start using the template with the QtCreator IDE. To open the project follow the steps below:
```diff
File Menu >> Open File or Project... >> select "Path/To/CMakeLists.txt"
```


### Using binaries

You can download the necessary binaries for your platform from the release section on the right-hand side of the main page. After downloading and installing, simply open the application to start using it.
